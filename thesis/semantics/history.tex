\section{History}

\citet{Huet75} gave the first semi-decision algorithm for unification of 
terms in the lambda calculus.  
Later, \citet{miller1986higher} proved
that for terms in the pattern fragment of the lambda calculus, unification was decidable.  
\citet{pfenning1988higher} demonstrated unification 
for the typed lambda calculus and considered solving the dynamic pattern fragment where non pattern equations
are postponed.
\citet{elliott1989higher} gave a more efficient algorithm for unification in the context 
of dependent types. Later \citet{pfenning1991unification}
did the same thing for unification in the ``Calculus of Constructions'', although without a mixed prefix.  
The most succinct presentation is from the 1991 paper describing the workings of Elf 
\citep{pfenning1991logic}.  While the unification algorithm implemented in the interpreter for Caledon is 
an extension of that presented in \citet{pfenning1991unification}, 
I briefly cover here the main ideas from the presentation of the paper describing the workings of Elf, 
and extend those ideas later.
