\section{Pure Type Systems}

The type system for caledon is a pure type system \citep{mckinna1993pure} 
extended with explicit recursive types and implicit types.  In this section
I discuss what a pure type system is and what it's properties are.

Pure type systems are generalizations of the lambda cube
\citep{barendregt1991introduction} which allow for arbitrary 
relationships between terms and types.
With proper selection of constants, sorts, axioms, and relations
pure type systems can embed the calculus of constructions \citep{coquand1986calculus}
and almost any other type system one could imagine.

As generalizations these systems are important, as it has been proven by Jutting \citep{jutting1993typing} that 
type checking for pure type systems with finite axiom sets are decidable.  Thus, by showing how a system is a pure type system, 
you get decidability of type checking nearly for free.

It has also been shown that these systems have utility.  
Roorda \citep{roorda2001pure} gave an implementation of a functional programming language with 
pure type system and demonstrated its utility.

A pure type system is a set $S$ of sorts, 
$A\subseteq S \times S$ of axioms, and a relation 
$R \subseteq S \times S \times S$ along with the following grammar and inference rules:

As Barendgregt points out, the common type theories can be recast as pure type systems
by choice of axioms.  
In the simplest example, the only axioms chosen are $(*,\Box)$ along with 
the single relationship $(*,*,*)$. This system describes the simply typed lambda calculus, 
where only terms can depend on terms.  We say that $A \rightarrow B \equiv \Pi x : A . B$ iff $ x \notin FV(B)$.

\begin{theorem} 
Subject Reduction: If $\Gamma \vdash A : T$ and $A \equiv_\beta B$ then $\Gamma \vdash B : T$
\end{theorem}

Geuvers and Nederhof \citep{geuvers1991modular} proved subject reduction for any calculus on the $\lambda$ cube.
This property can be proved syntactically by induction on the structure of terms $A$ and 
there exists Twelf and Agda verified proofs of this property.  Note that this is a usefull property 
to maintain even in the face of inconsistency of a system as it at the very least allows 
for a consistent understanding of typing terms.

\begin{theorem}
Uniqueness of Types: If $\Gamma \vdash A : T$ and $\Gamma \vdash A : T'$ then $T \equiv_\beta T'$
\end{theorem}

The beta reducable uniqueness of types has also been shown for any system on the $\lambda$ cube.  
This last property is important to showing the decidability of type inference in 
the caledon language without implicits.



\begin{lemma}
Strengthening
\[
\infer-[\m{strength}]
{
\Gamma \vdash M : U
}
{
\Gamma , x : T \vdash M : U
&
x \notin FV(M) \cup FV(U)
}
\]
\end{lemma}

As it turns out, the strengthening lemma has important implications to the generation of bindings 
during proof search.
