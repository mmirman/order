\section{Inference for CICC}

In order to make use of the implicit system of $CICC$, an inference
relation must be provided.  
This is accomplished by extending the typing rules and providing
a mapping from the extended type derivation and term to 
an original type derivation and term. 

\newcommand{\judgeCI}[0]{ \vdash_{i^-}}

Let $\Gamma \vdash A : T \wedge B : T'$ stand for $\Gamma \vdash A : T$ and $\Gamma \vdash B : T'$.
 
\begin{definition}

%% strength %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\infer[\m{strength}]
{

{
\Gamma, x : T  \judgeCI M : U

}
\]

%% inst/b %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\infer[\m{inst/b}]
{
\Gamma \judgeCI M \{ n = N \} : [N/x]U 
}
{
\Gamma \judgeCI M : ?\Pi n,x : T . U
&
\Gamma \judgeCI N : T
& 
n \notin GN(M)
&
n \notin BN(U)
}
\]

\end{definition}

In $CICC$, as in $CC$, the strengthening rule is admissible,
while in $CICC^{-}$, it is not.  

The rule $\m{abs/f}$ might appear to not make sense at first
glance since it abstracts to a known term, but it can be considered
equivalent to an existential pack without the pack proof term, since
$x \notin FV(M)$  

Conversion is now restricted to $\beta$ to accommodate the Church-Rosser theorem which is necessary to prove subject reduction.

We do not need semantic related properties and thus the semantics of $CICC^{-}$ is unimportant, since we will be
elaborating to the sublanguage $CICC$ before evaluating and type checking further. 

However, the substitution theorem holds.

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{(Substitution)}
\[
\infer-[\m{subst}]{ 
\Gamma, [N/x]\Gamma' \judgeCI [N / x]M : [N/x]T_2
}{
\Gamma, x : T_1, \Gamma' \judgeCI M : T_2
&
\Gamma \judgeCI N : T_1
}
\]
\label{ci:sub}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{(Subject Reduction)} If $\Gamma \judgeCI M : T$ and $M \rightarrow_{\beta*} M'$ then $\Gamma \judgeCI M' : T$

\label{ci:sr}
\end{theorem}

\ref{ci:sr} is at the moment believed to be true, 
although no full formalization exists.  Provided reductions are restricted to $\beta$ conversion, the Church-Rosser 
theorem is simply provable and the proof of subject reduction is similar to that in the traditional ``Calculus of Constructions.''

Without the $\m{abs/f}$ rule, subject reduction becomes unnecessary for the metatheory since 
the single direction subtyping relation is sufficient.  However, unification becomes difficult to implement.  

Unfortunately, the projection function now requires more information than is available syntactically, 
and thus must be given on the typing derivation.

\begin{theorem}

\textbf{(Soundness of extraction)}  

\begin{alignat}{4}
\Gamma &\judgeCI &  & \implies & \CICCproj{\Gamma \judgeCI}^c & \judgeCI &
\\
\Gamma &\judgeCI & A : T & \implies & \CICCproj{\Gamma \judgeCI}^c & \judgeCI & \CICCproj{ \Gamma \judgeCI A : T }
\end{alignat}

\label{cicc-:sound}
\end{theorem}

Since $CICC$ permits $\eta$ equivalence and $CICC^-$ does not, the extraction in the 
reverse direction is no longer sound.  For our purposes, this is not objectionable 
since $CICC$ is known to be consistent and there is no reason to convert back into $CICC^-$, as it is 
used entirely as a pre-elaboration language.  Once terms are typechecked and type inferred in $CICC^-$,
they are typechecked in $CICC$ and normalized in $CICC$.  
While the reverse extraction is generally not sound, normal terms with normal types are clearly typable in $CICC^-$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Subtyping %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Subtyping}

Similar to $ICC$, these rules result in a subtyping relation, which will be of
importance during type inference and elaboration.

\begin{definition}
Subtyping relation:
$\Gamma \judgeCI T \leq T' \;\; \equiv \;\; \Gamma, x : T \judgeCI x : T'$  where $x$ is new.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Subtyping is a preordering:
\[
\begin{array}{lr}
\infer-[\m{refl}]{ 
\Gamma \judgeCI T \leq T
}{
\Gamma \judgeCI T : s
}
&
\infer-[\m{trans}]{ 
\Gamma \judgeCI T_1 \leq T_3
}{
\Gamma \judgeCI T_1 \leq T_2
&
\Gamma \judgeCI T_2 \leq T_3
}
\end{array}
\]

\[
\infer-[\m{sub}]{ 
\Gamma \judgeCI M : T'
}{
\Gamma \judgeCI M \leq T
&
\Gamma \judgeCI T \leq T'
}
\]
\end{lemma}

This theorem is an application of the substitution lemma.

\begin{lemma}
Domains of products are contravariant and codomains are covariant:

\[
\begin{array}{lr}
\infer-[]{ 
\Gamma \judgeCI \Pi x : T . U \leq \Pi x : T' . U'
}{
\Gamma \judgeCI T' \leq T 
&
\Gamma,x : T' \judgeCI U \leq U'
}
&
\infer-[]{ 
\Gamma \judgeCI \forall x : T . U \leq \forall x : T' . U'
}{
\Gamma \judgeCI T' \leq T 
&
\Gamma,x : T' \judgeCI U \leq U'
}
\end{array}
\]
\end{lemma}

Unlike traditional subtyping relations where an explicit subtyping rule must be included in the type system,
this system's subtyping relation is much easier to manage during unification, because it is simply
a macro for a provability relation.  

This allows one to implement higher order unification with minimal modification,
as in a lattice unification algorithm.  
The modification is made to the search procedure, and subtyping constraints 
are realized as search terms.  

However, with the addition of the strengthening rule, 
this kind of modification is not entirely necessary, 
since it is provable that this subtyping relation is symmetric \ref{ci:sym}, 
and thus an entirely symmetric unification algorithm can be presented.

Theorem \ref{ci:sym} is not obvious at first glance, 
so I will provide intuitive justification first.

In $CICC$, by uniqueness of types, 
$\Gamma \vdash x : A$ and 
$\Gamma \vdash x : B$ implies
$A \equiv_{\beta\eta*} B$.  
In $CICC^{-}$ however, there is no such uniqueness of 
types properties.  
Rather, the $\m{inst/f}$ and $\m{abs/f}$ 
rules permit one to respectively
add and initialize an implicit argument, then
abstract implicitly upon an unused argument. 

Thus if $\Gamma , x : ?\Pi n,z : T . A \judgeCI x : A$
by implicit instantiation of the argument $n$,
we might also
derive
$\Gamma , x : A \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T . A$
given that $z \notin FV(x)$ and that 
$\Gamma , x : ?\Pi n,z : T . A \judgeCI x : A$ 
implies $ \Gamma , x : ?\Pi n,z : T . A \judgeCI$ 
which implies $ \Gamma\judgeCI x : (?\Pi n,z : T . A) : K$.

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{(Symmetry)}
$\Gamma \judgeCI A \leq B $ implies 
$\Gamma \judgeCI B' \leq A' $. where $A \equiv_{\beta} A'$ and $B \equiv_{\beta} B'$
\label{ci:sym}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

This is proved by induction on the structure of the proof
of $\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI x : B$.  Here I only consider 
the cases relevant to the new fragment.

\setcounter{tcase}{0}

%%%%%%% STRENGTH %%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcase}
We begin with the non admissible strengthening rule.
\end{tcase}

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : A, z : T \judgeCI x : B$}
\AxiomC{$z \notin FV(x)\cup FV(B) \cup DV(G)$}
\RightLabel{strength}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI x : B $}
\end{prooftree}

from this we can derive via the induction hypothesis, $\Gamma, x : B', z : T \judgeCI x : A'$ 
and then reapply strengthening.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : B', z : T \judgeCI x : A'$}
\AxiomC{$z \notin FV(x)\cup FV(A') \cup DV(G)$}
\RightLabel{strength}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : B' \judgeCI x : A' $}
\end{prooftree}

%%%%%%% INST %%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcase}
In this case we cover implicit instantiation.
\end{tcase}

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z :T . B$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI N : T$}
\AxiomC{$z \notin DV(\Gamma, x:A)$}
\RightLabel{inst/f}
\TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma,x : A \judgeCI x : [N/z]B $}
\end{prooftree}

Suppose $z$ is not in $FV(B)$ then $[N/z]B \equiv B$.   
From this the following proof is possible:

The first steps are the following few derivations:

\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$\Gamma,\judgeCI B' : K $} 
  \AxiomC{$z \notin FV(B')\cup FV(K) $} 
\RightLabel{streng}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma,z:T',  \judgeCI B' : K $} 
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$\Gamma \judgeCI T': K' $} 
  \AxiomC{$\Gamma,z:T' \judgeCI B' : K $} 

\RightLabel{form/f}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma \judgeCI ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' : K$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
 \AxiomC{$B \equiv_{\beta}B'$}
 \AxiomC{$z \notin B'$}
\BinaryInfC{$z \notin FV(B')$}
\end{prooftree}

From these, we can derive the following result about $B'$.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma,z:T' \judgeCI B' : K $} 

   \RightLabel{start}
   \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma,z:T', x : B' \judgeCI x : B'$}

   \AxiomC{$\Gamma \judgeCI ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' : K$}

   \AxiomC{$z \notin FV(x)\cup DV(\Gamma)$}
\RightLabel{abs/f}
\TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : B' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'$}
\end{prooftree}

Finally, we can derive the desired result:

\begin{prooftree}
   \AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : B' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'$}

      \AxiomC{$IH(\Gamma , x : A \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T . B)$}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' \judgeCI x : A'$}

  \RightLabel{subst}
  \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : B' \judgeCI x : A'$}

  \AxiomC{$z \notin FV(B')$}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B' \judgeCI x : A'$}
\end{prooftree}

The only unexplained axioms here are 
$\Gamma \judgeCI B': K$ and $\Gamma \judgeCI T' : K$ in this proof.
Because $\Gamma, x : A' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z:T' . B'$ is true, we know that 
$\Gamma, x : A' \judgeCI ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' : K$ and thus that 
$\Gamma,x : A' \judgeCI ?\Pi T' : K' $ and $\Gamma, x : A', z : T' \judgeCI B' : K$.  
By strengthening we can infer $\Gamma \judgeCI B': K$ and $\Gamma \judgeCI T' : K$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

On the other hand, if $z$ is in $FV(B)$ we achieve different proofs.  
Now we can infer that $x \notin FV(N)$, but we can not show that $[N/z]B' \equiv B'$.

By the induction hypothesis, we can infer $\Gamma , x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'\judgeCI x : A'$.

First, we know that $\Gamma,x : A \judgeCI [N/z]B : K$ by well formedness of the judgement 
$\Gamma,x : A \judgeCI x : [N/z]B' $ and the conversion rule.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI [N/z]B' : K$}
\AxiomC{$x \notin FV(B')$}
\RightLabel{strength}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma \judgeCI [N/z]B' : K$}
\RightLabel{start}
\UnaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B'\judgeCI x : [N/z]B'$}
\AxiomC{$z \notin FV(N)$}
\RightLabel{strength}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B', z : T\judgeCI x : [N/z]B'$}
\end{prooftree}

thus, we can use the $\m{abs/f}$ rule to construct a form we can use in substitution.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B', z : T \judgeCI (x : [N/z]B') \wedge N : T'$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B' \judgeCI ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' : K $}
\AxiomC{$z \notin FV(M) \cup DV(\Gamma)$}
\RightLabel{abs/f}
\TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'$}
\end{prooftree}

Finally, we get the following derivation.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : [N/z]B' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma , x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'\judgeCI x : A'$}
\RightLabel{subst}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma , x : [N/z]B' \judgeCI x : A'$}
\end{prooftree}

%%%%%%% ABS %%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcase}
In this case we examine the $\m{abs/f}$ rule.
\end{tcase}

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : A, z : T \judgeCI x : [N/z]B \wedge N : T$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' : K $}
\AxiomC{$z \notin FV(M) \cup DV(\Gamma, x)$}
\RightLabel{abs/f}
\TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : A \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T . B$}
\end{prooftree}

From this we can infer that $z \notin FV(A)$.  This is useful since we can derive:
\[
\Gamma, z : T, x : A \judgeCI x : [N/z]B \wedge N : T
\]

We can then apply the induction hypothesis to get the following:

\[
\Gamma, z : T, x : [N'/z]B' \judgeCI x : A'
\]

From this we can infer $\Gamma, x : [N'/z]B' \judgeCI x : A'$
by strengthening since $z \notin FV(x)\cup FV(A')$.

Furthermore, we can infer that $\Gamma \judgeCI N' : T'$ since $N' \equiv_{\beta} N$ 
so $\Gamma \judgeCI N' : T$ by subject reduction and $T' \equiv_{\beta} T$ so $\Gamma \judgeCI N' : T'$
by conversion.

We can also derive $\Gamma, x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'$ by the start rule. 

We get the following proof:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' \judgeCI x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B'$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma \judgeCI N' : T'$}
\AxiomC{$ z \notin DV(\Gamma)$}
\RightLabel{inf/f}
\TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' \judgeCI x : [N'/x] B'$}
\end{prooftree}

Finally, with the knowledge that $z\notin FV(A')$, we can derive the following:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' \judgeCI x : [N'/x] B'$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, x : [N'/x] B' \judgeCI x : A'$}
\RightLabel{subst}
\BinaryInfC{$\Gamma, x : ?\Pi n,z : T' . B' \judgeCI x : A'$}
\end{prooftree}

\end{proof}
