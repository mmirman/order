In this section, I introduce the specifics of the ``Caledon Implicit Calculus of Constructions'' ($CICC$).
The internal Caledon type system is an extension of the well known ``Calculus of Constructions'' with the 
addition of implicit bindings and explicit type constraints for implicit instantiation.  
While the inspiration for this comes from the theorem prover Agda, 
it appears as though no formal treatment
has been provided. This section provides a background on pure type systems 
and the history of the ``Calculus of Constructions''
and introduces a formal definition and treatment of $CICC$ with 
$\eta$ conversions for the purpose of type checking
and proof search.

The type system of Caledon is designed after two different formalisms for working with implicit arguments:  
the ``Bicolored Calculus of Constructions'' ($CC^{Bi}$) \citep{luther2001more} and 
the ``Implicit Calculus of Constructions'' ($ICC$) \citep{miquel2001implicit}.

It is comprised of two parts: The ``Caledon Implicit Calculus of Constructions'' ($CICC$), 
and the ``Implicit Caledon Implicit Calculus of Constructions'' ($CICC^-$). 
$CICC$ is a custom modification of $CC^{Bi}$ with Church-style binders and explicit constraints and 
externally named binders
reminiscent of module type theory \citep{dreyer2003type}.
$CICC^-$ Is intended to be a combination of the first two, or a partial 
erasure system for $CICC$.
